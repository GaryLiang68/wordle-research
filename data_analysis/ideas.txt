- optimized game play on every step (optimal game step vs actual game step) 
- rhyme detector (rhyme overlap between game states)
- tokeizer syllables (token overlap between game states) (probability distribution of token overlap) (compare those to optimal game states tokeizer syllables)
- avg Levenshtein distance (between game states and optimal game states / between game states and previous game states)
- clean data (game path, ez/hard modes, correct answer)



the main report question is: 
- Prove ppl dont play optimally by comparing Actual # of guesses vs optimal # of guesses. then say that the reason is casue they rely on rhymes or stuff like that - Probability distribution of token overlap, avg Levenshtein distance, and rhyming between the game play states.
- How optimal do human player play on each step by comparing their game path characteristics to optimal game path characteristics
